# better-codeserver
CodeServer, but with Arch Linux image and some useful tools for Railway
### Why this thing is exist
The reason I created this is because I need base-devel, git, nodejs, and some CLI utilities thus an always up-to-date system is good
### How to use this?
Just create new project and import from github I guess?
Yet this project is still WIP
